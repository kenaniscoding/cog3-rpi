        "&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In this activity, we will be familiarizing with the capabilities of a single board computer (SBC). Particularly, we will explore the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi as a versatile single-board computer (SBC) for implementing computer vision and deep learning algorithms on subsequent activities. As a low-cost, compact platform, the Raspberry Pi offers an accessible way to deploy real-world artificial intelligence applications, making it a valuable tool for students, hobbyists, and developers alike.\n",
